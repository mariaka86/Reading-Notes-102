## ways to declare a Javascript variable
-using var,let, const or nothing

## what are variables 
variable- a container for storing data or data values
examples can include letters such as x,y and z as long as they're declared with var
ex: var x= 2; var y=8; var z= x+y;

## javascript declarations
let and const can replace the *var* declaration in the previous example or just leave the variables undeclared (nothing)
the declaration *let* and *const* were added onto javascript in 2015 if you want your code to run in an older browser use *var*
general rule is to always use *const* as a declaration unless the value will change the use *let*

## Javascript Identifiers
all javascript variables must be indentified with unique names (identifiers)
Javascript idenfiers are case-sensitive
equal to operator is == in JS not =
good programming practice requires you to declare all variables at the beginning of a script
